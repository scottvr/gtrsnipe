```python
# guitar_tools/converters/ast_to_ops.py

import ast
import inspect
from typing import List
from ..core.operations import Operation, GuitarOperation

class ASTToOperationsConverter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_beat = 0.0
        self.operations: List[GuitarOperation] = []
    
    def convert(self, func) -> List[GuitarOperation]:
        """Convert a Python function to guitar operations"""
        source = inspect.getsource(func)
        tree = ast.parse(source)
        
        # Find and process function definition
        for node in ast.walk(tree):
            if isinstance(node, ast.FunctionDef):
                self._process_node(node)
                break
                
        return self.operations
    
    def _process_node(self, node: ast.AST):
        match node:
            case ast.BinOp():
                self._process_binary_operation(node)
            case ast.Compare():
                self._process_comparison(node)
            case ast.Assign():
                self._process_assignment(node)
            case ast.If():
                self._process_if_statement(node)
            case _:
                for child in ast.iter_child_nodes(node):
                    self._process_node(child)
    
    # ... rest of AST processing methods
```

Next we need the core operations.py that this depends on:


```python
# guitar_tools/core/operations.py

from dataclasses import dataclass
from enum import Enum
from typing import Optional, Any

class Operation(Enum):
    LOAD = "load"
    STORE = "store"
    ADD = "add"
    SUB = "subtract"
    MUL = "multiply"
    DIV = "divide"
    MOD = "modulo"
    COMPARE = "compare"
    JUMP = "jump"
    RETURN = "return"

@dataclass
class GuitarOperation:
    operation: Operation
    fret: int
    string: int
    beat: float
    technique: Optional[str] = None
    value: Optional[Any] = None
```
